Insights:

* Customers in the range 20-30 are responsible for more than 42% of the total purchased products.
* Customers in the range 16-20. 60-70 and 70+ are responsible for the 8% of the total purchased products
 *Customers in the range 30-40, 40-50 and 50-60 are responsible for 16% of purchased quantity each.
Indeed a very similar situation to the purchases quantity can be found in the earnings analysis, since customers who buys more, on average leads to higher earnings for the company.
The age group 20-30 is by far responsible for the highest earnings for the company (41.9% of total earnings).

We can see that customers in the range 20-30 and 30-40 have the lowest percentage of fashion news frequency, while being the groups which buy the most.
Moreover, the frequency of customer that regulary check fashion news starts increasing from the range 40-50, with a peak value of 43.7% of regular/active users for customers in the range 70+ years old. This means that checking fashion news seems to be more effective for older customers, who still represent a small percentage of total sold products, while younger customers do not need to check the news to buy new products.
It could be effective for the company to invite younger customers (range 20-40) to check the news more frequently in order to increase the sold items.
